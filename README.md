click ok and install the 1.20.1 client, make sure it's the client.

Now open the MC launcher, you should see the Forge 1.20.1 there.

Click on installations up top.

Click the 3 dots on the Forge 1.20.1 installation then click edit.

On this line, change whatever number after -Xmx to either 6 or 8, but not more than 10 (depends on how much ram your pc has, I would start at 4 and go up if needed).

Click the Save button. 

Now let's move to adding mods...

Click on this Folder icon on the Forge installation.

You should see your .minecraft folder open up. In that same folder, open the mods folder. If you don't have it, create a new folder and name it mods.

Open the mods folder, delete all content in it 
(ctrl+A then del key on keyboard)

Now open this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/828iog3x0wyrwn5rkt4jt/AE4-oPs6Y8vlC8bIXCjLrSw?rlkey=gye9j228imhnnm7yhq38nx3dm&st=q5phs3cj&dl=0

Install the mods folder from Dropbox.

Open the mods folder you just downloaded, and the empty mods folder side by side. 

Click on the mods folder with everything in it, copy and paste it to the empty mods folder that is in your .minecraft folder. 

Close the folder.

Open the MC launcher and click play Forge 1.20.1
